      <p>Hi, my name is Stef Bezanis and I am an aspiring developer. I currently work at an online insurance start up called Insureon. I am working on the partnership side to help build and cultivate new relationships with potential business partners. I do a ton of analytics and work closely with the development team on a day to day basis. </p>

      <p>My experience at Insureon has finally pushed me to seriosuly pursue development, something I have been interested in for awhile now. The Northwestern Boot Camp, along with many hours of hard work, has helped me develop my programming skills. The fruits of my labor are proudly displayed on my Portfolio page. Please don't hesitate to contact me wth any questions or opportunities.</p>
